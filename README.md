go-http2-impl
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tildedave/go-http2-impl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tildedave/go-http2-impl)

Draft 12: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2-12

If you want a fully featured implementation there is a list maintained at the [HTTP/2 site](https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations).

I am using this project to learn Go; therefore, code is not guaranteed to be idiomatic, efficient, etc.  Use at your own risk.

I also have a [separate repository](https://github.com/tildedave/go-hpack-impl) with an HPACK implementation.
